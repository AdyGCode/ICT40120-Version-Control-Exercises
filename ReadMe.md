# Welcome to Git Exercises

A set of exercises to assist in learning and revising Git.

The structure is like an interactive tutorial.

Over time, the Session-XX folders will have a keyword added to the end to 
identify the purpose of the session.

For example: `Session-03-Starting-Repos`

## A note for Full Time Students

> When you are in class and have completed exercises and assessment work for a 
> class, why not spend the remaining time working on another subject's 
> assessments, and/or catching up.
> 
> That way you have less to do at home!
