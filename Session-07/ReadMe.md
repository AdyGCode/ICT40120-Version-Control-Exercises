In the presentation "Intermediate Git Commands" there was a phrase:

> *For temporally related changes, an insertion in the past is a deletion in
> the present*

In a short conversation with ChatGPT we got it to explain this to:

- a seven year-old
- an 18 year-old about to leave high school
- a student who is in their first semester of a one-year college programming
  course
- a developer of 20 years experience

Here are the explanations.

### Seven Year-Old

> Imagine you have a toy box where you keep your toys.
>
> Sometimes, you add a new toy, but later, you might decide to take out an
> old toy that you don’t want to play with anymore.
>
> So, when you put a toy in the box (that’s like an insertion), and you take it
> out later (that’s like a deletion), it means what you added before is now gone
> in the present.
>
> In Git, when you change something, it can feel like taking something out that
> you had put in before!

### 18 Year-Old

> In Git, when we talk about "temporally related changes," we refer to how the
> history of your project evolves over time.
>
> An "insertion in the past" means you've added something to your project, like
> a new feature or a line of code. If you later decide to remove or modify that
> feature in the present, it feels like a deletion.
>
> So, the changes you make now can affect things you’ve done before,
> highlighting the importance of managing your project history carefully.

### College Student

> The statement "For temporally related changes, an insertion in the past is a
> deletion in the present" means that when you add something to your project,
> like
> a line of code or a new feature, it becomes part of your project's history.
>
> If you later change your mind and remove that code, it seems like you’ve
> deleted something that was there before.
>
> This shows how important it is to keep track of changes in your project, as
> what you do now can affect how you view what you did earlier.

### Senior Developer

> The statement "For temporally related changes, an insertion in the past is a
> deletion in the present" reflects the nuanced relationship between version
> history and current state in Git.
>
> When you insert a change into your codebase at a certain commit, it
> establishes a historical context. If you later modify or remove that change, it
> creates a sense of deletion from the current perspective while still retaining
> its historical significance in the repository's timeline.
>
> This emphasizes the importance of understanding how changes propagate through
> your Git history and how current modifications can alter the interpretation of
> past states.
